            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;" > &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Swift's debut album, Taylor Swift, was made available on October 24th, 2006. She released five singles to promote the album and self-penned 11 of the songs. Nearly immediately after the album's release, the artist became famous, and the record lasted 24 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200's Country Albums chart. Acoustic guitars, violins, and banjos are given free rein as they strum along to stories of childhood pals who would later fall in love, summer romances that wouldn't last, and backroad encounters. "Picture To Burn" is a disgruntled teen's "Before He Cheats," substituting shooting whiskey for gossip websites, with the humor and skill of a seasoned musician. As one of the three songs she wrote entirely on her own, "Should've Said No" carries the same flame with a steadier touch. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The public didn't really grasp Taylor Swift's artistic potential until 2008's Fearless, although her debut album assured she would at the very least be a passing star. The songs "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me," which became immediate classics regardless of how much her style and tastes have changed, are the ones that (for the first time) cemented her place in the cultural zeitgeist. Therefore, it made logical for this, her second studio album, to serve as the first altar in the "Taylor's Version" re-recording tale. This album garnered her four Grammys, including Album of the Year. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; When Taylor Swift, at 20 years old, published Speak Now, it featured her storytelling abilities. With heightened production from soon-to-be-mainstay producer Jack Antonoff, who uses an undercurrent of drums that boom like palms on metal doors and vocals that echo as if off skyscrapers, she fully transitioned from country music in 1989 after flirting with it in Red two years before. The album discusses the line that blurs between maturity and childhood as well as Taylor's captivating talent for turning any memory — no matter how charming or difficult — into a scene that seems like your own. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; "Red's music and lyrics had a broken-hearted feel to them. It was all over the place, a jumbled mosaic of emotions that ultimately came to make sense. Happy, liberated, perplexed, abandoned, devasted, ecstatic, wild, and tormented by old memories." Of course, the completed item is sterling. Her first three albums are primarily daydreams about love. On Red, though, it's "a merciless game" and a "worthwhile struggle," never simple but always enthralling to the point of nausea. In "State Of Grace," which opens the album with a prologue that is reminiscent of U2, it is said that we should "fall in love till it hurts, bleeds, or fades in time" before declaring, almost joyfully, that she will "never be the same." Taylor herself referred to it as her "one genuine breakup record," and today, just like her, whatever grief caused us to formerly clutch to Red for consolation is (hopefully) behind us.</p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Taylor's 1989 album represents something of a comeback, not just because it is titled after the year she was born, but also because it marked her first significant crossover from country to pop music. Instead, 1989 is sonically exuberant without sacrificing depth or relying too much on familiarity. However, there is always a hollow foil track from 1989 for every genuinely outstanding song, with "Shake It Off" and "Bad Blood" being the biggest offenders. Between those two extremes, there is a steady stream of incredibly catchy mega-hits that spread through Top 40 countdowns and later TikTok videos. The minor connections between songs create a tight narrative web that eludes casual listeners but dazzles Swift's ardent fans, who by this point are used to her treasure hunt antics. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Without a question, Taylor's most divisive work to date is Reputation. Taylor eventually abandons her ten-year-old good girl reputation in favor of the villain alter-ego created by the media when Kanye started a raging Twitter rant, choosing to settle the score by doing what she does best: exploring new aural terrain. She abandons her cheery synth-pop this time in favor of overt trap vibrations and heavy-handed hip-hop, which sound like loud emergency strobes disturbing a pitch-black cityscape. When it was first released in 2017, many listeners weren't very impressed by what they perceived as fake-edgy antics, the equivalent of a prep wearing black lipstick on a bad day. </p>

The follow-up to Reputation, Lover, is a blushing cheek shining with pink reflection and aspirations for the future, whereas Reputation before it was a dangerous, aggressive side-step hidden in a smokey eye. Taylor again reverts to her tried-and-true toolkit, leaning on romantic impulse and heavenly daydreams: living room waltzes, paper promise rings, creeping through gardens, and bouncing down streets. This may be Taylor's way of making up for that previous album's wave of unfavorable publicity. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; At the height of isolation and uncertainty, Taylor Swift's mythology emerged from the shadows; it was created and published during the first COVID summer. For lonesome, torn-apart fans worldwide, Swift's door to escape opened, and they jumped headfirst into the cottagecore sound groove and reveled in her surprising turn into barer-boned, folk-styled lyricism with hushed electro-adjacent overtones throughout. Folklore, however, offers contradictory viewpoints on a love that has long since been gone by hiding easter eggs in the lyrics in the form of repeated themes (a favorite cardigan), locations (cobblestone walks), and actions (coming up in a car, declaring love on the porch). These minute similarities across songs create a shimmering narrative weave that floats beyond the listener's consciousness.  </p>

Evermore, another covert distant cooperation, explores fresh character studies with a recognizable folk-infused air of coulds, woulds, and shoulds. It serves as a sort of epilogue to the backwoods mythology and backdoor interactions on folklore. Her album announcement states, "I liked the ways you embraced the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your life. I simply continued to write them. </p>

The song "Today was a Fairytale," which is equally as magical and catchy as Fearless' signature songs but was unfairly added on to the soundtrack for the regrettable 2010 movie Valentine's Day, should also be included (wherein Taylor made her acting debut as a kissing partner for then-boyfriend Taylor Lautner). </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The 2021 version of Red lassos listeners' almost decade-old passion and nostalgia for the songs and herds them into an encore of admiration, just like the "Taylor's Version" before it did. Taylor honors her then 22-year-old self by jeering and crying on cue, but this time with an inherently more mature air. She is once more musically true to the original material she generated. The long-awaited 10-minute version of "All Too Well," an extension of the already expansive song that is widely regarded by reviewers and fans alike as her magnum opus (which, for an artist of Taylor Swift's stature, is really saying something), is undoubtedly the album's crowning achievement. On "Taylor's Version," what once seemed (or perhaps now seems) like the end of the world is also a tribute to resilience: we'll get through it and do it again and again. </p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px; font-size: 20px;"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A return to routine and a rare pleasure, midnights are both. It's Taylor's first autobiographical album in three years, following an astounding switch to fiction in folklore and the subsequent re-recording of Fearless and Red (the last three of which will all be released in the next 11 months). After that barrage of releases, no one would have blamed her for taking a well-earned creative break. However, Taylor has repeatedly shown that she is an artist with momentum. Thus, the master of promotional whimsy revealed an album would be released in August, covered her website in a countdown that read, "Meet me at midnight," posted the premise of "the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life," and ceremoniously revealed the track titles from an old bingo machine in a TikTok series. The stakes were so high since expectations were so high; how close can Taylor fly to the sun? She's still soarin', said Midnight. </p>
