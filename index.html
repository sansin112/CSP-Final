            <p class="defalt"> &emsp; Taylor Swift showed interest in music at a young age and participated in many theater productions. She was only 11 years old when she sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before a basketball game. A year later, she started writing songs on the guitar. She took her inspiration from many music artists and created original songs. At age 14, she met with the recording-industry and signed with Sony/ATV as a songwriter. She performed many of the songs she wrote and was noticed by Scott Borchett, a record executive. She finally released her first song, “Tim McGraw”, which was an immediate success. Swift went on tour at age 16 and opened for many famous artists. She received the Horizon Award for Best new artist from the Country Music Association. Although Taylor never talked about her relationships at interviews, she spilled her heart out through her songs. In 2008, she released her first album, Fearless, which was an immediate success. That same year, she was nominated for “Best New Artist.” While releasing music, Taylor also made her debut in the romantic movie Valentine’s Day and also did voice acting. In 2012, Taylor released her first album guided towards the pop genre. The songs “All Too Well," "22," and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” were an immediate success. Finally, Taylor’s completely pop album 1989 was released in 2017, and more than 10 million copies of her first album were sold. Over the years of her music journey, Taylor has won a total of 11 Grammys and is bound to win so many more awards. In November, As a result of Scooter Braun owning the masters to her music, Taylor decided that as soon as her contract allowed—November 2020—she would begin re-recording and releasing her previous albums. She also announced plans to add bonus songs that never made it onto the originals. She released Fearless (Taylor's Version) on April 9, 2021, and Red (Taylor's Version) November 12, 2021. </p>
